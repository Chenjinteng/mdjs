WSLGit


Use Git installed in WSL(windows Subsystem for Linux) from Windows and Visual Studio Code.

The project was inspired by A. R. S.'s project andy-5/wslgit written by Rust.

Usage
Please make sure git have been installed in your WSL.
one-liner: sudo apt install git -y
Copy wslgit.sh to /usr/bin/ in your WSL.
Configure your VSCode settings.json, set git.path as the path to file git.bat located in this project, example:
{
	"git.path": "C:\\path\\to\\git.bat"
}
Principles
Transfer git invoking from Windows batch file git.bat to wslgit.sh located in WSL.
Convert Windows path in parameters to Linux path by wslpath or awk
Convert Linux path in git output back to Windows path.
Convert path by wslpath if git output only contains one Linux path
Otherwise, convert path by awk following WSL mounted drvfs list (mount -t drvfs)
